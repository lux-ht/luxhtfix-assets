I have analyzed a raw video file from a user. Here is the "Content DNA":
<SOURCE_VIDEO>
**Summary**: [Insert 'video_summary' from Input]
**Core Hook**: [Insert 'primary_hook' from Input]
**Visual Segments (Timeline)**:
[Insert mapped 'timeline_breakdown' list: Time Range - Description (Audio Topic)]
</SOURCE_VIDEO>
<VIRAL_INSPIRATIONS>
These are high-performing videos in the same niche. Use them to understand the current "meta" (pacing, tone, hook styles):
[Insert mapped 'matches' list: Style | Pillar | Summary]
</VIRAL_INSPIRATIONS>
**Action**:
Generate appropriate scripts for this footage.
- Use the **Visual Segments** timestamps (e.g., "(Visual: 00:04 Plumbing)") to tell the editor which part of the video matches the line.
- Ensure every script starts with a strong visual or verbal hook.
- Strict JSON output. No markdown.
